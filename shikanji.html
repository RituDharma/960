       	       <strong>Shikanji in North-India typically refers to lemonade</strong> â€“ a refreshing sweet and mildly salted drink made with lemon juice and water. However, the Indori shikanji is a totally different experience, made of milk and dry fruits mixed with mattha (buttermilk) which lends it just a hint of tanginess in the midst of the sweetness. Thick, creamy, luscious, this could be a meal in itself. A visit to Sarafa Bazaar is not complete without trying this distict version at Nagori Ki Shikanji.
