       	       If you have a craving to try the best Chole tikki in India, this is the place to be. It is a small shop which pops up in the Sarafa market in the night, and has the best of tastes.<br> 
       	       You might have tried yaha waha ki chole tikki  but Dude it’s <emp style="color:red;">Indore</emp> it has to be different and yummy the tikki (cutlet) is shallow fried in pure ghee. The chutney’s they add are absolutely superb and guess what they add Paneer in this dish. It's a totally new experience.
