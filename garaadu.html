                 A winter specialty, Garadu is made with chunks of purple yam, fried to crispy perfection and served topped with spices, chillies and lemon juice. Though it is sometimes available in the summer, the yam is quite tasteless and dry so try it only if you are at Sarafa from October till Februray.

                 <strong>“You have to come here in winter to try ratalu!!”</strong></i> Large chunks of the starchy purple yam,locally known as <i><strong>garaadu</strong></i>, stacked around frying pans. Sliced to order and then dunked in hot oil, ratalu is deep-fried to a uniform golden-brown and generously smothered in red chilli powder or <i>giravan</i>(a local spicy powder). Crisp on the surface with just the right amount of give, the ratalu will sing in your lips with its hing-heavy spice coating. Like the best winter snacks, it will also fill you with a sense of warmth and wellbeing.
