              <strong>"The Dahi Vada"</strong>—steeped in chilli, unsweetened yoghurt and topped with a colourful riot of spices—is crowd-pleasing, but not spectacular. But Joshi’s flair and the thrill of being one among many outstretched hands reaching out for a plate of his <strong>“magic”</strong> dahi vadas, lent it a particularly memorable flavour.A sprinkle of coriander powder, a pinch of chilli powder, and a daub of amchur (raw mango powder) later, the snack was ready to be served.Surrounded by families, courting couples and groups of friends, all gleefully inflicting calorific damage to their waistlines.
              Make sure to pay a visit to Joshi Dahivada House, a permanent outlet renowned for its dahivada (and owner Om Prakash Joshi’s flip-in-the-air trick that accompanies it).
