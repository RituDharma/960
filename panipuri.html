       	     <strong> 10 flavours of pani puri:</strong> <br>
              Pani puri at Sarafa is a must-try for the innovative flavours that the vendors serve in addition to the usual tangy, minty water. While the stuffing of mashed, boiled potatoes is not unusal, there are distinct flavours of water to choose from. Each puri is dunked in a new flavor before being gentle placed on your plate. Some of the flavours include: Jeera (with a hit of earthy cumin); lehsun (spiked with garlic); hajma hajam (tangy like Hajmola); pudina (with the pronounced flavour of mint); and hing (pungent, full-bodied, smacking of asefoetida)
